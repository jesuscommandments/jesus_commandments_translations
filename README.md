# jesus_commandments_translations
This repository contains all translation files from English to other languages. We use Google translate to make a first automated translation. The next step for the translator is to review all translated items and acknowledge them through the admin panel of the website. 

_**All Bible references are automatically imported with the configured Bible Translation for that language**_
